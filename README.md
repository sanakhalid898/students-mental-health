# Analyzing Students' Mental Health
Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health? This project aims to explore this question by analyzing student mental health data using PostgreSQL. The dataset originates from a survey conducted in 2018 by a Japanese international university, with the study approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.

The study revealed that international students are at a higher risk of mental health difficulties compared to the general population. Key findings indicated that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are significant predictors of depression.

In this project, we delve into the data to verify these findings and investigate additional factors such as the length of stay and its impact on mental health. The repository includes SQL scripts, data preprocessing steps, and results to provide a comprehensive analysis.

Data Description
The dataset includes various columns that capture demographic and behavioral variables such as:

International Student Status
Depression Levels
Social Connectedness
Length of Stay
Acculturative Stress
Other relevant demographic details
By leveraging SQL queries, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that can inform interventions and support services for students facing mental health challenges.
